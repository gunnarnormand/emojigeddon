				<article class="paper">
					<p class="alegreya">The series of frustrated messages show a deepening rift between those who adhere to the organization's original mission to code old and obscure and minority languages and those who are investing time and resources toward Unicode's newer and most popular character sets: emojis, a quirky periodic table of ideograms and smiley faces that cover everything from <span class="emoji-text" id="laugh">bemused laughter</span> to <span class="emoji-text" id="poo">smiling piles of poop.</span> The correspondence offers a peek behind the scenes of the peculiar and little-known organization that's unexpectedly been tasked with building what some see as <b class="alegreya-bold">the first digital universal language.</b></p>

					<p class="alegreya">In a series of acerbic emails on a chain celebrating Unicode and emojis' mention on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last March, legendary Unicode contributor and typographer Michael Everson railed against the consortium, suggesting that the organization's focus on emojis is <span class="emoji-text" id="discussion">hurting the work of scholars like himself.</span></p>
					<p class="alegreya">"It's delightful that people are happy about Mr. Colbert, but I can tell you that many people are thinking that the UTC has lost the plot," he scolded.</p>

						<li class="alegreya">Why are their regulation and evolution overseen by a bunch of language nerds and engineers?</li>

					<p class="rubik">But for others, emojis' ubiquity makes the character set a meaningful mode of expression that transcends traditional linguistic barriers - vegetable sexting included - and is quite the opposite of a dumbed-down "cartoon." Language or not, they argue, when millions of people zealously adopt a new way to communicate, it becomes important whether Everson, Unicode, or any linguist, typographer, or academic agrees.</p>

					<p class="alegreya">Part of the reason for Everson's passion and frustration is the sense that ongoing encoding work is, in the internet age, <b class="alegreya-bold">akin to a human right.</b> To demonstrate, he explains a tribal alphabet used in India that, until recently, had never been encoded.</p>
					<p class="alegreya">"Now those people who use this alphabet have the right and ability - if they have a computer and electricity - to write their names in their language. There's something powerful about that. Their rights have been met," he said. "And there are more like that. We're not finished." <span id="blink">|</span></p>
